    <p>I am a data analyst at Beaconhouse Group in Lahore, Pakistan. Beaconhouse is a K-12 school system that has more than100 branches throughout Pakistan. My primary goal is to recognize patterns that lead to improvement in student performance. These would include the patterns in attendance across various branches and cities, the relationship between taking different subjects together in O and A Level etc. As Beaconhouse is evolving into a more data driven organization, my role also includes various other Data Science projects as they arise.</p>
<p>Born in a small town in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan, I lived and studied there till 7th grade. Afterwards I moved to a Cadet College in Kohat where I studied for the next 5 years. I completed my Bachelor's in Political Science and Economics as a joint major in Lahore, Pakistan in 2015 and then joined the Beaconhouse Group in January 2017. During the early phases of my career I focused on learning various data analysis tools like MS Excel, Power BI and tableau. However, as the data size grew and the amount of analysis required increased, I developed a keen interest in Python and started using it in my day to day tasks. When I am not working, I am mostly spending time on Data Camp, or blogging about Python. </p>
